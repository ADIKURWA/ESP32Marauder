# Swiftpair Spam
Swiftpair spam creates BLE Swiftpair traffic sourcing from randomly generated MAC addresses. This causes repeated notifications for BLE device pair on Swiftpair enabled devices, such as Windows PCs. This method of attack was created by [@Spooks4576](https://github.com/Spooks4576). To exit the attack, press anywhere on the screen and you will be returned to the Marauder menu.
