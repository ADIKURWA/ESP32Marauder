<b>The ESP32 Marauder must be connected to a target machine via USB</b>  
Test the functionality of the ESP32Marauder 7's BadUSB capability. This ensures the BadUSB is working by running a harmless Ducky Script `STRING` command.  
It is recommended this be run against a target machine with a text editor open and as the top most window.
