# Auth Flood

### Menu Location
`WiFi`>`Attacks`>`Auth Flood`  

### Info
The ESP32 is capable of transmitting specially crafted WiFi packets. In an authentication flood, an attacker will flood an access point with authentication requests. This causes the buffer of open requests to fill which prevents the access point from authenticating other legitimate clients.

*Implementation coming soon*
