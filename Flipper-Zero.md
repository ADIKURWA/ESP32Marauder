#Flipper Zero WiFi Dev Board with Marauder

### Summary
The Flipper Zero has the option to attach different peripherals to it's GPIO headers. One such option is the ESP32-S2 Development Board which provides the Flipper Zero with the hardware required for WiFi capabilities. The Marauder firmware can be installed on the ESP32-S2 either via prebuilt firmware binary uploaded [over-the-air(OTA)](installing-firmware-via-ota) or via [configured source build and upload](installing-firmware-from-source)

### Usage
Marauder can be used via its [command-line interface](cli) supplemented by the Flipper Zero USB-to-UART bridge and a PC/Laptop. The goal is to eventually get the Flipper Zero to offer a bluetooth connection to facilitate a Serial-over-Bluetooth bridge to the WiFi Dev Board so everything can be done over mobile phone.
