# ESP32 Marauder Kit
The ESP32 Marauder Kit is a bundle of hardware components that allow a user to assemble a fully functional ESP32 Marauder. All that is required from the user is that they must provide their own [Adafruit Huzzah32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) flashed with the ESP32 Marauder firmware, and a 3.7V LiPo battery compatible with the Huzzah32.
