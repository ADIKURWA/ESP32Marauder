# Evil Portal
The evilportal command spawns an access point and hosts a webserver. The webserver serves a web page with username and password forms. Once a client connects to the access points and attempts to access any web page, they will be redirected to the web page served by Marauder. Any credentials they enter in the username and password fields will be displayed in Serial, Screen, and logs. Evilportal can be stopped with [stopscan](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/stopscan) (tapping the screen on TFT models).

See [evilportal](evilportal) for usage info.
