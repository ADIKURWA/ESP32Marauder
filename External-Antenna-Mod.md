# External Antenna Mod
For versions of the ESP32 Marauder that feature an ESP-WROOM with an internal PCB antenna, this documentation applies. These are ESP32 modules which do not feature an option for connecting an external antenna like IPEX/UFL. The process involves modifying the internal PCB antenna of the ESP32 Marauder in such a way that the transition is final. There will be no way for the ESP32 to function without an external antenna.
