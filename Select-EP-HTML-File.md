# Select EP HTML File
Allows the user to select from a list of HTML files available on their SD card. The file name will be saved and used during the next Evil Portal session. The file name is volatile and will not persist beyond reboots and power cycles. On the Marauder Mini, this will appear on the menu as one button. Use the up and down directions on your tactile switch to cycle through the file names and the center button to confirm your selection. On the full size Marauder models, the list will be presented in a scrollable format and once a file is selected, you must select the back button at the top of the list to return to the menu.

### Special Note
In order for your menu list to be populated with files, you must place HTML files on the root of your SD card and their extension must end with `.html`.
