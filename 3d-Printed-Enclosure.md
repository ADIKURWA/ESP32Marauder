# 3d Printed Enclosure
The ESP32 Marauder sold on Tindie comes with its own 3D printed enclosure. If you want to replace the enclosure that came with yours or you want to try to fit your own hardware in an enclosure and have access to a 3D printer, you can download the STL files [here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/tree/master/3Dfiles) or from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4146626).

Instructions from Thingiverse  
Components of the project:
  - ESP32 Marauder
  - 4 M2.5x10 Hex screws
  - Enclosure face plate
  - Enclosure body

How to do the thing:
1. Print both the face plate and the body
2. Mount the face plate onto the screen of the Marauder by putting the pegs through the holes on the screen PCB
3. Lower the Marauder into the body of the enclosure and ensure the battery sits within the trench in the center of the body
4. Fasten the face plate to the body using 4 M2.5x10 hex screws.
    - The top of the screws should be flush with the surface of the face plate
