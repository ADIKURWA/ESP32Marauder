# Marauder Command Line Interface
This feature is actively being developed for firmware v0.9.6. The goal is to produce command line interface which can be used over hardware serial and/or bluetooth serial. In theory this will allow anyone with an ESP32 and a TX/RX or phone with bluetooth to make and use their own Marauder.

For full usage on how to establish a connection to the Marauder command line interface, see [Usage](cli-usage)

Here are the currently supported commands:
  - [scanap](scanap)
  - [stopscan](stopscan)
  - [clearap](clearap)
