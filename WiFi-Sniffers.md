WiFi sniffers passively and in some cases actively capture WiFi traffic. Some sniffers are general and cover a broad spectrum of traffic types while others capture a very specific category of WiFi packet. If an SD card is inserted, sniffers will automatically save captured packets as PCAP files with the appropriate name. The following sniffers can be used to capture WiFi traffic:  

- [Probe Request Sniff](probe-request-sniff)
- [Beacon Sniff](beacon-sniff)
- [Deauth Sniff](deauth-sniff)
- [Packet Monitor](packet-monitor)
- [EAPOL PMKID Scan](eapol-pmkid-scan)
- [Detect Pwnagotchi](detect-pwnagotchi)
- [Detect Espressif](detect-espressif)
