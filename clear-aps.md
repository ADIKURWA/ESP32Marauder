The ESP32 Marauder maintains a list of access points to be used in a variety of WiFi based attacks. The list is stored in memory and is cleared anytime the ESP32 Marauder is powered off or rebooted.  

Once this option is selected, the ESP32 Marauder will clear any access points added to the list by [Scan APs](scan-aps).
